# Stories and personas
- **Matteo Favretto, 24 years old, uni student**
  Matteo is a frequent customer, so he's requested his personal fidelity card. 
  He'd like to obtain his discount easily so that they can be applied automatically, just showing his fidelity card.
  Moreover, he would like to save some money getting coupons and exploiting product offers.
  **Goals**:

  - accumulate shopping points
  - save on shopping

  **Story**
  Matteo is shopping and he decides to buy products on offer in order to save up.
  Also, he decides to use his fidelity card's points - which he knows from the last invoice - in order to obtain a discount on the total cost.
  He's also deciding whether keeping on shopping such with the aim of reach the requested spending threshold for obtaining a coupon.

- **Alberto Castrignano', 22 years old, cashier**
  Alberto is one of the shop's cashier and he wants to be as efficient as possible in sales managing
  so he exploit the automatic coupons managing mechanism and the possibility of selecting products already registered into the
  cash register which would require more time for their checkout.
  For the sake of convenience, he uses the cash register's locking mechanism to not waste time when he needs to get away from the workstation.
  **Goals**:

  - save time in sales managing
  - save time in resuming the activity

  **Story**

  Alberto is serving a customer when he needs to scan a barcode of an heavy water box. So he tells to the customer to keep that article into the
  cart because he'll insert it into the transaction's list of products using the "quick access products" function.
  After completing the transaction, Alberto gets called by the owner and so he decides to lock the cash register using the lock button.
  Once he has come back, he resumes his activity just inserting his own account password.

- **Vincenzo Sagristano, 23 years old, shop manager**
  Vincenzo is a meticulous manager: he wants to keep trace of everything, including expiry dates and the exhaustion of products.
  As soon as necessary to get a new product supply, he looks for the related supplier to contact him.
  He cares about his customers, so he often generates promotions on products, trying to encourage them to shop and supporting the usage of fidelity cards.
  **Goals**:

  - avoid running out of products
  - increase the amount of customer

  **Story**

  Vincenzo, at the end of the day, notices that some products are running out. So he decides to contact the related supplier for those products in order
  to obtain new supply. He also notices that some products are going on expire because they are little purchased, so he decides to create promotions to get rid of them.

- **Francesca Silvano, 23 years old, small shop owner**
  Francesca has a small shop and she has a trustful relationship with her employees, but she doesn't tolerate pointless losing of incomes or lack of competence.
  She keeps trace of the shop's balance daily and she checks that any sale is efficient even using periodically updated charts and diagrams.
  **Goals**:

  - check the income
  - managing the employees

  **Story**
  Francesca gets a notification about the lock of the account of an employee, Alberto, due to multiple incorrect password insertion: it's the fourth time only this month.
  She also notices a decreasing in income and she decides to check what are the cash registers from which she obtains the less income.
  So she find out that the worst cash register in term of income is the one used by Alberto, whom efficiency is not compensating his clumsiness.
  She decides to fire him, so she calls him into her office to warn him. At the end of the day, after the closure of the activity, she provides to remove him account from the system.

- **Angela Orwell, 50 years old, manager**
  Angela has a huge experience as shop manager: during her 25 years of career she has faced a recurrent problem in managing coupons
  for promotions in her small shops. She'd like to have a way to manage promotions, to enable or disable the usage of a given category of coupons
  and to know the expiry date of each class of coupons. She would love to be able to have a detailed view on the employees in order to
  manage all their information.
  **Goals**:

  - manage coupons
  - manage employees

  **Story**

  Angela uses her experience to think about the best expense ranges to set for the generation of coupons. To cover the periods in which there are less customers, she thinks about the best coupon expiration period to tempt her customer into doing shopping.
  Then, she welcomes the new cashier, Andy, and creates an account for her.

- **Andy Warhol, 38 years old, cashier**
  Andy is a 38 years old cashier. She is used to be very lazy and she would like to be able to access to her terminal in a quick way.
  Moreover, she would love to have a snap mechanism which helps her with heavy and frequent products during the checkout phase.
  Some times ago, she was working when she was suddenly needing to go to the restroom,
  but nobody was near her cash register to make sure nobody tries to access and now, thinking about that episode,
  she'd love to be able to lock the cash register in a quick way in order to be allowed to get away safely.
  **Goals**:

  - quick access the cash register
  - manage fast products

  **Story** 

  Andy starts her working day and makes a quick access to the cash register, without many procedures.
  It is an heavy day at job, so she reads as less products as possible, introducing them with the list of fast accessible products.
  Then she decides to make a quick pause and go to the restroom, so she locks the cash register in security and goes away from it.

The CSV file can also contain both new products to be added to the inventory, and products to restock, and the database will be updated to consider both operations. In case of restocking there is no need to check the consistency of the quantity, because a restock always increases it |
