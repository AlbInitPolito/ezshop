Authors: Matteo Favretto, Vincenzo Sagristano, Alberto Castrignan√≤, Francesca Silvano
Date: 21/04/2021
Version: 1

# Contents
- [Estimate by product decomposition]
- [Estimate by activity decomposition ]
# Estimation approach
<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>
# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   | 23 |
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       | 90 |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 2070 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 207 |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 6210 |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 1,4 |
